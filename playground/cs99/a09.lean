-- With this command we add a notation for `add`. From now on we will be able to write `m + n` for
-- `add m n`. The 65 denotes how strongly the operator should bind to what's adjacent to it.
-- The `priority` means that Lean will prefer it over the built-in `+`.

def mul (m n : Nat) : Nat :=
  match n with
  | zero   => zero
  | succ n => (mul m n) + m

-- We also want a notation for `mul`, with a higher binding strength than addition so that
-- `a + b * c` means `a + (b * c`)`.
infix:70 (priority := high) " * " => mul

inductive LE : Nat → Nat → Prop where
  | refl (n : Nat) : LE n n

-- Let's start by reproving some theorems from last week, but this time with tactics!
-- useful tactics:
-- * `induction ... with ...`
-- * `rw [f]` to unfold applications of a function `f`
-- * `rw [h]` to rewrite every `a` to `b` if `h : a = b`
-- * `apply/exact`
-- * `simp/simp_all`... are powerful and basically always useful, though make sure that you could also
--   do the proof without them

-- Let's now prove a theorem about trees. We will define a tree as either a leaf or a node with

-- The mirror image of a tree is obtained by swapping the left and right subtrees of each node.

  | leaf           => leaf
  | node l v r     => node (mirror r) v (mirror l)

-- The `@[simp]` attribute tells Lean to automatically unfold the definition of `mirror` when
-- using `simp` or `simp_all`. This is similar to what we did for addition and multiplication.

-- Finally, let's define a `reverse` function for lists and prove an interesting
-- property about it: that reversing a list twice gives you the original list back.
